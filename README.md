This project presents a model that combines an Attention-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) to classify plant health using imagery captured by UAVs. The architecture is optimized to effectively extract both spatial and relational features, making it well-suited for applications in precision agriculture.
